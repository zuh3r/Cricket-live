## Project 2 - SEI - General Assembly
Full stack SPA (Single Page Application) using API interaction and JavaScript DOM manipulation completed in a group of four.

## Our Plan/Approach
### 1 - Wireframing
We first hard-coded mock data from news articles and current matches along with a header navigation panel and a footer at the bottom of the page. This would be helpful for when API implementation was added in the following steps.
Wireframing was also completed for each page that was to be rendered, including login and sign up pages.

### 2 - Backend Development
A table was created to house user information which was used to initialise sessions on the page for login functionality.
Currently in development is a feature to allow users to set preferences for which matches would render on the landing page.

### 3 - API Implementation
All match data and news articles were pulled from APIs and rendered on the landing page

### 4 - User Functionality
Users are able to create profile with an email and password used to log in. Users can then update their name and email by selecting ‘My Account’. Logout functionality is also implemented.

## 5 - Technologies Used
